# Warehouse Manager API test plan

Document version 1.0.7

## Introduction

The Warehouse Manager API test plan contains information on the tests that are designed to establish the proper functioning of the backend implementation of the Warehouse Manager API.

## In Scope

The project's tests are unit and integration tests. Completed tests are noted with ✔, while the pending ones are noted with ⌛.

### Unit tests

Focus is placed on the validation rules of the Mongoose schemas. The tests involve the following directories and files:

```text
└── src
    ├── models
    │   ├── customer.model.js
    │   ├── order.model.js
    │   ├── product.model.js
    │   ├── stock.model.js
    │   └── user.model.js
    └── resources
        ├── validationErrorMessages.js
        └── validationRegExp.js
```

Tests are conducted per model:

- User model [✔] ,
- Customer model [✔],
- Product model [✔],
- Stock model [✔],
- Order model [✔]

### Integration tests

#### Backend integration test(s)

The tests are meant to check the integration of backend directories and files. Focus is placed on the express-validator middleware and the responses generated by the controllers. It primarily involves the following directories and files:

```text
└── src
    ├── controllers
    │   ├── customer.controller.js
    │   ├── product.controller.js
    │   ├── stock.controller.js
    │   └── user.controller.js
    └── middleware
        └── expressValidationRules.js
```

The tests are conducted per operation:

- User registration [✔],
- Customer addition [✔],
- Customer information update [✔],
- Customer deletion [✔],
- Product addition [✔],
- Product information update [✔],
- Product deletion [✔],
- Stock creation [✔],
- Stock information update [✔],
- Stock deletion [✔],
- Order addition [✔],
- Order deletion [✔]

#### Auth logic integration test(s)

The focus of these integration tests is the auth directory and its contained files:

```text
└── src
    └── auth
        ├── authController.js
        ├── authResponseMessages.js
        └── authValidationRules.js
```

The tests are executed per login outcome. Separate tests are also included for web token verification:

- Successful user login [✔],
- Failed user login [✔]
- Web token verification [✔]

#### Database integration test(s)

The integration between the backend (middleware + controllers) and the MongoDB database is the main theme for these tests. Since middleware and controller behavior has already been tested, focus will be placed on limited operations per collection.

- **users** collection:
  - auth processing [✔]
- **customers** collection:
  - customer processing [✔]
- **products** collection:
  - product processing [✔]
- **stocks** collection:
  - stock processing [✔]
- **orders** collection:
  - order processing [✔]

## Out of scope

The Warehouse Manager API is a backend project, therefore any tests referring to the frontend are excluded.

## Assumptions

The backend implementation is ongoing. MongoDB is the database of choice.

## Environments + Tools

The primary tool for unit testing is the Jest testing framework:

```json
"jest": "^29.7.0",
```

Jest may also be used for the smooth running of integration tests.
